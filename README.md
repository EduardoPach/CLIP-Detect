# CLIP-Detect
Zero Shot Object Detection with CLIP model

TO-DO's:

- [x] Making preprocessing to patches available in utils and easier to use
- [ ] Add tests to check that Tensor movements are working (probably other tests as well)
- [ ] Find a better way to output bbox's in CLIPDetection
- [ ] Generalize plot_detection 
- [ ] Add Occlusion based detection
- [ ] Add some cool detection animation/visualization (showing method)
